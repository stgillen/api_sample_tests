Sample api tests using Artillery IO

What concerns would you have from a testing perspective?
    Who will use these tests amongst development team? 
    How will they be used/env moving forward (locally, CI env, etc.)?
    Will we need to do capture performance/load metrics?

How would you go about tackling the QA for this work?
    Organizing tests by documentation Table of Contents

What sort of tests would be worth describing or worth automating?
    Start by automation calls on most/common used sections first.  

What tools would you use?
    Artillery IO, quick setup with Nodejs, easy to write/read test cases, with ability to apply load to endpoints if necessary
